# RAG-LLM App

## Overview
The RAG-LLM App is a sophisticated Python application that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide enhanced and contextually relevant responses. This app integrates retrieval mechanisms to fetch relevant documents and uses LLMs to generate coherent and informative outputs based on the retrieved information.

## Features
- **Document Retrieval**: Efficiently retrieves relevant documents from a large corpus based on user queries.
- **Language Generation**: Utilizes state-of-the-art LLMs to generate detailed and contextually appropriate responses.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines retrieval and generation for improved accuracy and relevance.
- **Customizable Pipelines**: Easily customizable retrieval and generation pipelines to suit various use cases.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large-scale data and high query volumes.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-llm-app.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd rag-llm-app
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your data corpus and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3. Use the provided API endpoints or command-line interface to interact with the app.

## Configuration
- **config.yaml**: Customize the retrieval and generation settings in the `config.yaml` file.
- **models/**: Place your pre-trained models in the `models/` directory or specify the paths in the configuration file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- transformers
- faiss
- pandas
- numpy
- flask (for API deployment)
